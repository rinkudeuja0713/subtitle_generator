  Wow, what an audience. But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk. 
 
2
 00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000 
  I don't. I care what the internet thinks of my talk. Because they're the ones who get 
 
3
 00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000 
  it seen and get it shared. And I think that's where most people get it wrong. They're talking 
 
4
 00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000 
  to you here. Instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the 
 
5
 00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000 
  click. You see, back in 2009, we all have these weird little things called attention spans. 
 
6
 00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000 
  Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead. I'm trying to think of the 
 
7
 00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000 
  last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk. It's been years, literally years. So if you're 
 
8
 00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000 
  given a TED talk, keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right 
 
9
 00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000 
  now. That means we've got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.
